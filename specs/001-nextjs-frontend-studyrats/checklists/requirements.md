# Specification Quality Checklist: Next.js SSR Frontend for StudyRats Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 26 functional requirements map to at least one acceptance scenario
- Success criteria use user-facing language only (no API response times, framework names, etc.)
- The graceful degradation behaviour for the missing backend endpoint is explicitly specified
- Docker deployment requirement (FR-026) is captured as a user-facing constraint (single-command startup, SC-007)
- Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`
